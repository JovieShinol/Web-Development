        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Cafe Coffee Day, a part of Coffee Day Global Limited, is India's favourite hangout for coffee and conversations. Popularly known as CCD, we strive to provide the best experience to our guests. Our coffees are sourced from thousands of small coffee planters, who made us who we are today and we're glad to be a part of their lives. We opened our first cafe in 1996 at Brigade Road in Bangalore the youth and the young at heart immediately took to the cafe, and it continues to be one of the most happening places in the city. CCD to the youth is a “hangout” spot where they meet people, make conversations, and have a whole lot of fun over steaming cups of great coffee.It's been an exciting journey since then to becoming the largest organised retail cafe chain in the country.</p>

        <h4>COFFEE DAY HOTELS & RESORTS</h4>
            <p>2008 was a landmark year for Coffee Day Global Limited. At this point of time, we decided to invite our friends and extended family to the coffee estates themselves to experience, first-hand, the serene slopes on which their coffee grew. Coffee Day Hotels & Resorts was formed as a subsidiary of Coffee Day Global Limited, the Chikmagalur resort of The Serai was declared open.The philosophy was single-minded - to open exclusive retreats in the quietest corners of the country and to offer an experience drenched in luxury and understated elegance. It is a place where one would come to be pampered like nowhere else. The Serai, Chikmagalur, as the first such resort did this job brilliantly, nestled as it was in the greens of the lush coffee plantations around.The concept was so appreciated that we took these resorts to other reclusive niches – to Bandipur and Kabini.
